**Credits**

 - I dedicate this compiler to Mr. Richard P. Siewert, a great computer science teacher at McMillen High School, who helped to further my computer science education, and was a very great person overall, and sadly passed away during the making of this program.
 - The APERL specification rev. 2017 is the property of the College Board, and can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20170711045615/https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf) on pages 118-124.
 - The [Super Tiny Compiler](https://git.io/compiler) by Jamie Kyle (jamiebuilds), which this was based off of.
